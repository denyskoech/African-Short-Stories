                <p>A collection of new and old speculative fiction from Africa, featuring the top ten stories from Short Story across Africa's rich cultural beliefs. Short stories date back to oral storytelling traditions which originally produced epics. Oral narratives were often told in the form of rhyming or rhythmic verse, often including recurring sections or epithets</p>
                <p>A key obstacle to learning to read is the shortage of appropriate stories for early reading in African languages. There are few or no picture books for young children, and very little material of any kind in the 'familiar' languages of most African children. Since young Africans have very little to read in familiar languages, they often do not learn to read well or enjoy reading. This in turn means that there is not a market for African language books and publishers cannot afford to produce many such books. So young Africans end up with very little to read and the cycle continues. The African Short Stories website aims to intervene positively in this vicious cycle in order to create the numbers of stories in the numbers of languages needed for African children to learn to read fluently and with enjoyment.</p>
